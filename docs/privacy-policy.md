- This interaction is governed by the [Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy)
- Wikipedia may receive your IP address as part of standard internet protocols

The App is an independent application and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Wikimedia Foundation.

## Bookmarks

Article bookmarks you create are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is backed up with your device backups (if iCloud Backup is enabled in your device settings)
- Can be deleted by removing the App

## Your Rights and Choices

You can control the App's access to your location through your device settings:

If you deny location access, the App will function in a limited capacity using search only.

You can delete all locally stored data by uninstalling the App.
